# golitath_mobile
Golitah mobile is a 4 wheel drive AVG that serves as mobile base for the robot arm.

I'm working hard to get all simulation files in place. For the robot_base this is not done yet. 

To get started with the real robot you need 2 complete and well working hoverboards. 
Follow this link for a  video guide on how to get the hoverboard to work

This repository focus is on the combined control of the robot arm on a mobel base link
